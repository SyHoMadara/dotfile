      <description>
        This setting is used by the proxy switcher to store the most recent active state, to allow us to toggle
        from 'none' to the previous active state. This setting is always either 'auto' or 'manual'. If the system
        is already in the active state, this setting will mirror that state.

        The default of 'auto' is chosen to be consistent with the default in the Settings menu when the proxy 
        is disabled.
